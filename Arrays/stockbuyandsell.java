// 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

// You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

// You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

// Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.


// BruteForce Approach
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int profit=0, maxProfit=0;
        // Loop through each day -> consider each day as a potential buy day
        for(int i=0; i<prices.length; i++){
            // Loop through all future days -> consider them as the potential sell day
            for(int j=i+1; j<prices.length; j++){
                profit = prices[j]-prices[i];
                // Check profit for every j(or every future day)
                maxProfit = Math.max(profit, maxProfit);
            }
        }
        return maxProfit;
    }
