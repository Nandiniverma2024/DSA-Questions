## 🔹 Problem Statement

Suppose a user selects **10 topics** they want to study.  
Every time they refresh, they get a **5-topic quiz** generated randomly.

**Question:** How many unique 5-topic quizzes can be generated from 10 topics?  
✅ This is where **Pascal’s Triangle** and **Combinations (nCr)** come in!

## 🔧 What This Code Does

1. ✅ Calculates total possible quiz combinations using `C(n, r)` via Pascal's Triangle.
2. 🧠 Randomly generates a quiz of size `r` from `n` topics.
3. 🔁 On each run, you get a different quiz combination.
